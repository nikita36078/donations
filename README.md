# Android Donations Lib

Android Donations Lib supports donations by Google Play Store, Flattr, PayPal, and Bitcoin.

It is used in projects, such as OpenKeychain, AdAway, FasterGPS, and NTPSync.

**NOTE: Google mailed me to remove PayPal donation capability when publishing on Google Play! Thus, you should build "product flavors" defined by the example: One version with Google Play donation capability and one with Paypal, Flattr, and Bitcoin!**

## How to use

1. Add dependency to your build.gradle:
    ```
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.nikita36078:donations:2.7'
    }
    ```
2. Instantiate the fragment where you want to use it. Check out the example app for this: [DonationsActivity.java](https://github.com/sufficientlysecure/donations/blob/master/example/src/main/java/org/sufficientlysecure/donations/example/DonationsActivity.java)
3. Don't forget to pass through results in ``onActivityResult()`` back to the fragment as shown in [DonationsActivity.java](https://github.com/sufficientlysecure/donations/blob/master/example/src/main/java/org/sufficientlysecure/donations/example/DonationsActivity.java).
4. When publishing the app you must create managed in-app products for your app in the Google Play Store that matches the ones you defined in ``private static final String[] GOOGLE_CATALOG``

## Build flavors
1. Keep in mind that Google forbits other payment methods besides Google Play. Thus, in the example, two build flavors are used. Check out [ExampleApp/build.gradle](https://github.com/sufficientlysecure/donations/blob/master/example/build.gradle). The build script adds ``DONATIONS_GOOGLE`` to the auto generated BuildConfig.java.
2. Add ``<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`` to product flavors that use Flattr
3. Add ``<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />`` to product flavors that use Google Play In-app billing
